# Correction Plan

Based on the identified issues, I'll make the following corrections:

1. Create a requirements.txt file
2. Fix inconsistencies between README and code
3. Consolidate duplicate code (analyze_image.py and image_analyzer.py)
4. Add proper error handling for OCR dependencies
5. Fix path issues in batch file
6. Improve Python package structure
7. Remove debug print statements
8. Create a basic implementation for environment variables
9. Fix naming inconsistencies

Let's start with these corrections one by one.
