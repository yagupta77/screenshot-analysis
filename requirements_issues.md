# Requirements and Issues Analysis

## Dependencies
Based on the codebase analysis, the following dependencies are required:

1. **Python 3.6+** (as mentioned in README.md)
2. **OpenCV** (cv2) - Used in ocr/extract_text.py for image processing
3. **Pytesseract** - Used in ocr/extract_text.py for OCR functionality
4. **Tesseract OCR** - Backend for pytesseract (optional path configuration is commented out)

## Issues Identified

### 1. Inconsistency between README and actual code
- README describes the project as "Security Analyzer Tool" for analyzing text
- The actual code implements a screenshot/image analysis tool that extracts text from images and then analyzes it
- Repository name is "screenshot-analysis" but README doesn't mention screenshot functionality

### 2. Duplicate code in analyze_image.py and image_analyzer.py
- Both files have nearly identical functionality
- Both extract text from images and analyze it for security issues
- Creates maintenance issues and confusion about which file to use

### 3. Missing requirements.txt file
- README mentions installing dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- No requirements.txt file exists in the repository

### 4. Incorrect repository URL in README
- README installation instructions mention `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/screenshot-analyzer.git`
- Actual repository is at `https://github.com/yagupta77/screenshot-analysis.git`

### 5. Potential OCR configuration issues
- Tesseract path is commented out in extract_text.py
- No clear instructions for setting up Tesseract on different platforms

### 6. No error handling for missing Tesseract installation
- Code assumes Tesseract is installed and configured
- No graceful error handling if Tesseract is not available

### 7. Inconsistent naming
- Repository is named "screenshot-analysis"
- README refers to "screenshot-analyzer"
- Code refers to "Security Analyzer Tool" and "IMAGE SECURITY ANALYZER"

### 8. Unused environment variables
- Extensive .env.example file with many configuration options
- No code that actually uses these environment variables

### 9. No tests
- No test files or testing framework included

### 10. Debug print statement in production code
- extract_text.py contains a debug print statement that always executes

### 11. Potential path issues in batch file
- analyze_image.bat uses relative imports which may fail depending on execution context

### 12. No proper Python package structure
- Missing __init__.py files in directories
- Relies on sys.path manipulation in some cases

## Missing Functionality

1. No implementation for using the extensive configuration in .env.example
2. No integration with threat intelligence APIs mentioned in .env.example
3. No alert functionality (Slack, Telegram, Email) as suggested in .env.example
4. No automated response capabilities as suggested in .env.example
5. No MISP integration as suggested in .env.example
6. No correlation or pattern learning as suggested in .env.example
