## 1. Package Structure Improvements
- Added proper `__init__.py` files to all packages and subpackages
- Created a more organized directory structure with utils subpackages
- Moved utility functions to dedicated modules for better code organization

## 2. Code Consolidation
- Consolidated duplicate code from `analyze_image.py` and `image_analyzer.py` into a single `analyze_screenshot.py` script
- Made the new script executable with proper shebang line
- Improved command-line interface with clearer options (--help, --text)

## 3. Error Handling and Logging
- Added comprehensive error handling throughout the codebase
- Implemented proper logging with the Python logging module
- Added platform-specific Tesseract OCR detection and configuration

- Specified minimum versions for all dependencies
- Added clear documentation on system dependencies (Tesseract OCR)

## 7. Code Quality Improvements
- Removed debug print statements in favor of proper logging
- Added type hints throughout the codebase
- Improved function and variable naming for clarity
- Enhanced code organization with better separation of concerns

## 8. Functionality Enhancements
- Improved OCR text extraction with better image preprocessing
- Added automatic Tesseract path detection for different platforms
- Enhanced error reporting with more helpful troubleshooting suggestions
- Added support for both image and text file analysis in a unified interface

## 9. Batch File Improvements
- The original batch file functionality is now incorporated into the main Python script
- Cross-platform support through Python rather than Windows-specific batch files

## 10. Testing
- Manually tested all functionality to ensure it works as expected
- Verified OCR text extraction works correctly
